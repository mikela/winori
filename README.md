Windows app to snap the selected window to any of the 4 corners of the screen.

It works much like "Windows key + Left key" or "Windows key + Right key", which will make the selected window take the left or 
right half of the screen. This app does the same thing but dividing the space in 4 (up left, up right, down left and down right).


The keyboard shortcuts are configurable. By default, they are:
- "LControlKey + Insert": Move window to the top left portion of the screen.
- "LControlKey + Home": Top right.
- "LControlKey + Delete": Bottom left.
- "LControlKey + End": Bottom right.
